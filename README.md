# Machine_Learning_Final_Project
**By: Sophie Margolis and Jeremy Sprung**

In our project, we focused on analyzing PE files (.exe) and explored the 23 features within our dataset using advanced techniques and machine learning models. We examined a collection of 60K distinct files to identify patterns indicative of malware behavior. Then, we created a classifier capable of predicting the likelihood of a given file being malicious.

Our process started with explanatory data analysis and preprocessing, continued with modeling using multiple techniques, and concluded by evaluating them with the AUC score metric on validation datasets.

Utilizing a Random Forest classifier, we achieved a test AUC score of 97.3% on an unseen test dataset and received a grade of 98 for the project.

**This project was done as a final project in Introduction to Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University.**
